    <p class="textright">Born to Scott and Andrea Swift on December 13, 1989, Taylor Swift grew up on a Christmas Tree
      Farm in Pennsylvania. At the age of 12, she learned how to play the guitar and what followed was a great deal of
      interest in songwriting. To pursue her hopes of becoming an artist, her family moved to Nashville when she was 13
      in an effort for her to enter the country music scene. In Nashville, she collaborated with several songwriters
      until she finally caught the eye of an up-and-coming record label, Big Machine Records. As one of their first
      signings, she began working on her debut album with some of their producers. On October 24, 2006, her self-titled
      album <i>Taylor Swift</i> was released. Her music tapped into an audience not previously explored: teenage girls
      who listen to country music. Being received quite well by the public, her debut album helped pave expectations for
      her following albums.

    <p class="textleft">After the release of Taylor Swift, her second studio album <i>Fearless</i> followed two years
      later on November 11, 2008. The album received critical acclaim and unprecedented success, flaunting global
      sensations such as <i>Love
        Story</i> and <i>You Belong With Me</i>. Relying on the tried and true formulas of country sound, it solidified
      her status
      as a rising star in the music industry. In addition to the album's success, Taylor Swift went on her first
      headlining concert tour, the Fearless Tour, selling out venues worldwide and demonstrating her capabilities as a
      live performer. The industry recognised her for her exceptional talent and achievements, and that only motivated
      her to achieve more. On October 25, 2010, she released the entirely self-written album, <i>Speak Now</i>. Although
      it
      didn't reach the same heights as her previous album, it consisted of songs like <i>Mean</i> that leaned into more
      confessional and diary-like qualities. The impressive feat of an entirely self-written album shut down the
      people who doubted her as a songwriter and gave her the confidence to grow as a musician.

    <p class="textright">After an exceptional start as an artist, she began moving away from country music and started
      experimenting
      with different sounds in her music. This decision proved to be instrumental for her career because it resulted
      in the creation of her fourth studio album, released on October 22, 2012. The album, named <i>Red</i>, topped the
      charts and served as a transition to her subsequent few albums, bringing forth a new era. After a glimpse into
      the pop genre with Red, she abandoned her country roots in exchange for the synth-pop sounds prevalent in the
      80s to create her most explosive work yet—<i>1989</i>. This album unveiled several singles before the official
      release
      date of October 27, 2014. Such teasers included <i>Shake It Off</i>, <i>Blank Space</i>, and <i>Bad Blood</i>, all
      songs that have
      maintained their popularity today. During this time, she also began exercising her newfound influence as an
      established celebrity by condemning music streaming services such as Spotify and Apple for failing to pay
      artists during the free trials that users subscribed to. This, alongside other charitable actions, kept her in
      the media's good graces.

    <p class="textleft">However, fame comes at a cost. Every celebrity must endure negative criticism at one point, and
      Taylor Swift is
      no exception. In early 2016, she faced heavy scrutiny for the infamous controversy between her and Kanye West
      that began at the 2009 VMAs. Deciding that stepping away from the public spotlight would be the best way to
      exclude herself from the narrative, she occupied herself at the studio, finding inspiration from the obstacles
      that faced her and striking back at Kanye with the single <i>Look What You Made Me Do</i>. Taking the world by
      storm, it was the first look Taylor Swift gave us for her sixth studio album, <i>reputation</i>, released on
      November 10,
      2017. Once again, she found ways to incorporate genres that had yet to be found in her previous music.
      Introducing the public to a darker electropop sound, the album included songs that showed hints of R&B and EDM
      influences.

    <p class="textright">With the release of <i>reputation</i> also came the end of Taylor Swift’s contract with Big
      Machine Records. Although she had the option to sign with them for a second term, she decided to sign with
      Republic Records and closed the
      chapter of Big Machine Records behind her. However, even though she was starting fresh with a new record label,
      she couldn’t leave her old works behind. Scott Borchetta, the founder of Big Machine Records sold her masters to
      Scooter Braun, someone who she does not have a good history with. This dispute over the ownership of her masters
      for her first five albums led to hard feelings between her and Scott Borchetta for years to come. However, she
      managed to put that aside and continue doing what she’s always done best. Exploring more of the subgenres in
      pop, she came out with the dream-like album <i>Lover</i>. Putting aside her public image, she found herself in
      music
      and approached the songwriting process with a more carefree attitude.

    <p class="textleft">A tour always follows a successful album. As Taylor was preparing to tour her new album, the
      pandemic stopped
      it and many other events from fruition. But even as she was confined to quarantine, she still managed to work on
      new projects. Months into the pandemic, she dropped <i>folklore</i> and <i>evermore</i> as surprise albums. The
      sister albums
      journeyed into the woods of indie folk and alternative rock, a massive pivot from her previous works. She showed
      the world her strong lyricism with poetic songs such as <i>my tears ricochet</i>, <i>mirrorball</i>, and
      <i>ivy</i>. As restrictions
      started to loosen, she revealed that she had been working on rerecording her first five albums, as a protest
      against the mistreatment she’s faced as a lone artist against a recording label that does not respect her.

    <p class="textright">The first rerecordings included <i>Fearless</i> and <i>Red</i>, both released in 2021.
      <i>Fearless (Taylor’s
        Version)</i> was released first on April 9, 2021, followed by <i>Red (Taylor’s Version)</i>, released on
      November 12, 2021.
      The rerecordings, branded with the signature Taylor’s Version, also brought additional songs not released with the
      original albums. These tracks, labelled From The Vault, included the iconic <i>All Too Well (10 Minute
        Version)</i>,
      which came with a short movie that Taylor Swift herself directed. Although she was revisiting old music, she still
      found new ways to express her creativity as an artist. In 2022, she took a break from the rerecordings and
      returned to creating mainstream music for the first time since the pandemic. With the release of <i>Midnights</i>
      on
      October 21, 2022, Taylor Swift hit what seemed to be her third peak of popularity as an artist. Coming back strong
      with unfamiliar sounds of dream-pop and bedroom-pop, she brought an alternative approach to the well-known pop
      music genre. The album starred tracks such as <i>Anti-Hero</i> and <i>Labyrinth</i>, incorporating the synths of
      vintage pop
      alongside the poetic lyricism seen in <i>folklore</i> and <i>evermore</i>.

    <p class="textleft">While her talented singing and songwriting may have been the foundation of her fame, Taylor
      Swift’s impact is certainly not limited to the boundaries of the music industry. As a celebrity whose career has
      spanned several decades, her influence as an artist only continues to grow. With each new step she takes, she
      continuously defies the limitations that held back artists who came before her. From philanthropic efforts to
      advocating for artists that may face the same obstacles she did, her positive impact on society leaves behind a
      legacy that will be remembered for generations to come.
